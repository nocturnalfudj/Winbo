                      Thank you so much for buying this asset!

When using it in your project, you only need the "FoxeyBlurArea" folder. Delete the
"Example" folder if you want, it only contains usage examples.

Attention: For the "Blur Noise" shader to work on Android, open the __ba_sh_blur_noise
shader and uncomment line 7: OS_Android
